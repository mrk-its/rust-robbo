bugs:
* do not move robbo if hidden
* killing robbo / Esc
* entering capsule doesn't work
* ForceField
refactoring:
* create core module / lib / crate independent of wasm / graphics / io
* do not hardcode level data in source code
* based on that create desktop & web versions
* learn more Rust & refactor everything!
